        // DESCRIPTION:

        // Your coworker was supposed to write a simple helper function to capitalize a string 
        // (that contains a single word) before they went on vacation.

        // Unfortunately, they have now left and the code they gave you doesn't work. 
        // Fix the helper function they wrote so that it works as intended 
        // (i.e. make the first character in the string "word" upper case).

        // Don't worry about numbers, special characters, or non-string types being passed to the function. 
        // The string lengths will be from 1 character up to 10 characters, but will never be empty.

        // My version

        function capitalizeWord(word) {
            let letters = word.split("");
            letters[0] = letters[0].toUpperCase();
            return letters.join("");
        }


        console.log(capitalizeWord('glasswear'));


        // Better version

        const capitalizeWord1 = word => word[0].toUpperCase() + word.slice(1);


        console.log(capitalizeWord1('glasswear'));
